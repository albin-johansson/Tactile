# tactile [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-alpha-red.svg)](https://semver.org) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1dsfluq6ep8yj5lr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AlbinJohansson/tactile)

A tilemap editor that aims to be easy-to-use, fast and lightweight. Furthermore, compatibility with

In its current state, Tactile shouldn't be used by anyone.
